# Thor::SCMVersion

Thor tasks to manage a VERSION file based on SCM tags, for use in
continuous delivery pipelines.

One of the key points of continuous delivery is that every build has a
version number, and that version number is unique and only points to
one build. Thor::SCMVersion adds some tasks to a Thorfile to use SCM
tags as the authoritative source of version status, so your continuous
integration server can create versions without having to worry about
file conflicts.

## Integrating into your project

Since Thor is written in Ruby, you'll need Ruby to make this work, on
your workstation and on your CI server. See <http://whatisthor.com/> for
more in how to use Thor.

### Get the gem

If you don't already have a Gemfile, you should probably get one. See
<http://gembundler.com/> for more details on Bundler and Gemfiles. Not
required, but will save you a lot of hassle.

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'thor-scmversion'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install thor-scmversion

### Add it to your Thorfile

All you need to do is require it at the top of your Thorfile:

    require 'thor/scmversion'

Now when you list your thor tasks you'll see 2 new ones.

    $ thor list
    
    version
    -------
    thor version:bump TYPE [PRERELEASE_TYPE]  # Bump version number (type is major, minor, patch, prerelease or auto)
                                              # Prerelease allows an additional parameter to be passed which is used 
                                              # as the prerelease type.
    thor version:current    # Show current SCM tagged version

Usage Examples:

    $ thor version:current
    1.2.1
    $ thor version:bump auto
    1.2.2
    $ thor version:bump major
    2.0.0
    $ thor version:bump prerelease
    2.0.1-alpha.1
    $ thor version:bump prerelease
    2.0.1-alpha.2
    $ thor version:bump prerelease beta
    2.0.1-beta.1
    $ thor version:bump minor
    2.1.0

### Remove your VERSION file from source control

Since your CI server will be managing your VERSION file, you don't
want it to be stored in your SCM anymore. Make a note of your current
version, then

    $ git rm VERSION
    $ echo VERSION >> .gitignore`
    $ git add .gitignore
    $ git commit -m "Drop VERSION as it is managed by thor-scmversion now"

### Create a tag for the current version

Now tag the current version manually. If it was 1.2.3:

    $ git tag 1.2.3
    $ git push --tags

You can make sure it worked by running `thor version:current` and
making sure it is what you expected.

### Integrate with CI

Now, as part of your CI job, before it builds your artifacts, have it
run `thor version:bump patch`. This will increment the patch, push the
new tag, and write the VERSION file. Now the artifact you build will
have the right version information, every time.

### You manage the major, minor patch and prerelease

When you make significant changes, you can bump the major, minor or patch
number yourself with `thor version:bump minor`. This will create a tag
with a .0 patch level, so the next build made by the server will be
.1 patch level.

### Auto bumping

If you include #major, #minor or #patch in the subject of commits, and run
`thor version:bump auto` it will see if any major, minor or patch level changes
are included since the last tag, and use the appropriate version. This works
especially well with a CI server, allowing you to never have to directly
manage versions at all. If no commits are tagged, the build number for the
current version will be bumped instead, this behaviour can be canged with the
`--default` command line option. If no commits are tagged the the, the level
given by the `--default` option will be bumpped.

    $ thor version:bump auto --default=patch

will bump the patch level of the version number if no commits are tagged.

NOTE: auto bumping currently only works for Git repos. For Perforce repos,
auto is the same as build.
